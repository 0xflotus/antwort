    <h2>Why use Antwort?</h2>
    <ul class="why-list">
        <li>
            <h3 class="why-headline">Works across all devices, including Outlook</h3>
            <p>Other solutions use <code>float</code>s, which many clients including Outlook don't understand. Antwort uses <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s for universal compability.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 class="why-headline">Mobile Emails don't have to be boring</h3>
            <p>A single column layout might work well on mobile but often prevents an underwhelming experience for desktop users. Why not satisfy both?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 class="why-headline">Bulletproof layouts: made with dynamic content in mind.</h3>
            <p>Originally made for transactional Emails with dynamic content so the layouts are thoroughly tested - in live environments with real data and edge cases.</p>
        </li>
